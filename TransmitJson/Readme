You have a list containing incoming messages.
All the messages in the list are plain text, but should be with the following JSON format:
{
    "transmitter": "abc:123456",
    "msg_time": "2019-03-15T10:26:37.951Z",
    "msg_type": 83,
    "message": "Hello World"
}


Please write a python code that goes over all the messages in the list, and does the following:
Make sure the JSON is valid

Make sure the transmitter has the following format: “<3 characters>:<numeric value>”
Make sure that the message is not older than 7 days
Msg type is one of the following (0000,83,84)
Messages that pass all validations should be placed in a corresponding list (list per type)
Messages that do not pass the validation (or fail for any reason) should be placed in a separate list with the failure reason (text)

        # Failed messages should be placed in a separate list with the failure reason
        # We will sort only by one condition (it can fail more than one validation)
